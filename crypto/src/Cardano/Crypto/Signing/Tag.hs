-- | To protect against replay attacks (i.e. when an attacker intercepts a
--   signed piece of data and later sends it again), we add a tag to all data
--   that we sign. This ensures that even if some bytestring can be deserialized
--   into two different types of messages (A and B), the attacker can't take
--   message A and send it as message B.
--
--   We also automatically add the network tag ('protocolMagic') whenever it
--   makes sense, to ensure that things intended for testnet won't work for
--   mainnet.
