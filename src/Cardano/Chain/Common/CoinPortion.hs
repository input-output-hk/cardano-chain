-- | CoinPortion is some portion of Coin; it is interpreted as a fraction with
--   denominator of 'coinPortionDenominator'. The numerator must be in the
--   interval of [0, coinPortionDenominator].
--
--   Usually 'CoinPortion' is used to determine some threshold expressed as
--   portion of total stake.
--
--   To multiply a coin portion by 'Coin', use 'applyCoinPortionDown' (when
--   calculating number of coins) or 'applyCoinPortionUp' (when calculating a
--   threshold).
