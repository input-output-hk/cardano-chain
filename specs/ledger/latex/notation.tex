\begin{description}
\item[Powerset] Given a set $\type{X}$, $\powerset{\type{X}}$ is the set of all
  the subsets of $X$.
\item[Sequences] Given a set $\type{X}$, $\seqof{\type{X}}$ is the set of
  sequences having elements taken from $\type{X}$. The empty sequence is
  denoted by $\epsilon$, and given a sequence $\Lambda$, $\Lambda; \type{x}$ is
  the sequence that results from appending $\type{x} \in \type{X}$ to
  $\Lambda$.
\item[Functions] $A \to B$ denotes a \textbf{total function} from $A$ to $B$.
  Given a function $f$ we write $f~a$ for the application of $f$ to argument
  $a$.
\item[Fibre] Given a function $f: A \to B$ and $b\in B$, we write
  $f^{-1}~b$ for the \textbf{fibre} of $f$ at $b$, which is defined by
  $\{a \mid\ f a =  b\}$.
\item[Maps and partial functions] $A \mapsto B$ denotes a \textbf{partial
    function} from $A$ to $B$, which can be seen as a map (dictionary) with
  keys in $A$ and values in $B$. Given a map $m \in A \mapsto B$, notation
  $a \mapsto b \in m$ is equivalent to $m~ a = b$.
